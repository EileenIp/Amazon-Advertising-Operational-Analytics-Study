Operational Analytics is a critical process in modern companies, aimed at analyzing end-to-end operations to identify areas for improvement. The primary objective of this project is to investigate metric spikes and provide actionable insights to improve the company's operations. 

The project will cover a wide range of areas, including user engagement, sales performance, marketing effectiveness, and more. You'll be provided with access to datasets containing user information, events data, and email engagement details.

## Analysis on Case Study 1: Performance Data Analysis
In this case study, I worked with the "job_data" table, investigating job-related metrics.  Tasks includes calculating the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020, deriving the 7-day rolling average of throughput, analyzing the language share over the last 30 days, and identifying duplicate rows in the data.
## Key Questions Explored

### Jobs Reviewed Over Time
Objective: Calculateing the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.
### Throughput Analysis
Objective: Calculating the 7-day rolling average of throughput (number of events per second).
### Language Share Analysis
Objective: Calculating the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days.
### Duplicate Rows Detection
Objective: Identifying duplicate rows in the data.

## Analysis on Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike
In this case study, I worked with three tables: "users," "events," and "email_events." Tasks involves measuring weekly user engagement, analyzing user growth over time, investigating weekly user retention, measuring weekly engagement per device, and analyzing email engagement metrics.

### Weekly User Engagement
Objective: Measuring the activeness of users on a weekly basis.

### User Growth Analysis
Objective: Analyzing the growth of users over time for a product.

### Weekly Retention Analysis
Objective: Analyzing the retention of users on a weekly basis after signing up for a product.

### Weekly Engagement Per Device
Objective: Measuring the activeness of users on a weekly basis per device.

### Email Engagement Analysis
Objective: Analyzing how users are engaging with the email service.
